# React Clean Architecture test - book management app

This is a training project in which I attempt to implement something akin to Clean Architecture in a React app.

The app itself is simple: it is a book management service that lets users keep a track of what books they are reading. Think Goodreads, but functionally streamlined for demo purposes.
